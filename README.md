# LN-Payments
System for receiving Lightning Network payments and generating single-use tokens


## Development
### Changes
Each change to the `dev` branch should be made so:
- Checkout at `dev` branch
- Create a new branch called `LP-XXX` where XXX is the task number assigned in Jira
- When your work on the branch is done push it (if you haven't already) and create a PR to the `dev` branch
- After successful code review merge the PR and delete your branch

Great, you have just placed your small brick in the house of LN-Payments 👏

If your branch is out of date rebase it onto the `dev` branch and force push it
