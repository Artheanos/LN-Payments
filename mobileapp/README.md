## Development
#### (Android only)

### Installation
Prepare the environment according to the React Native docs, except:

* Use `yarn` instead of `npx`
* Skip the "Creating a new application" part

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

### Running the app

`yarn android` compiles the java code, opens android emulator (if you have set up env paths according to the docs) and runs the metro server

`yarn start` only runs the metro server
