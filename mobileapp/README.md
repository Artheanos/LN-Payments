## Development
#### (Android supported only)

### Installation
Prepare the environment according to the React Native docs, except:

* Use `yarn` instead of `npx`
* Skip the "Creating a new application" part

### Running the app
Use `yarn android` when you initialize the project, make Java changes or want to turn on the emulator

For other cases use `yarn start`
